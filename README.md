# Combine Workshop
A workshop to get you started with the Apple Combine framework.

## How to?
- Watch and listen, Antoine explains you the basics using the [Combine Swift Playground](https://github.com/AvdLee/CombineSwiftPlayground)
- Work in pairs of two (more fun if you don't know each other yet!)
- Ask me to verify and give feedback on your step implementation
- Implement each exercise step!

## Four steps
- Connect a single UISwitch to a button enabled state
- Connect three UISwitch instances to a button enabled state
- Handle form validation
- Implement a search view to search for Swift repositories on Github

### Extra exercises if you're really fast!
- Step 3: Change the `UITextField` background color based on valid input to `.red` or `.green`
- Step 4: Set `UIApplication.shared.isNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible` to `true` when the request is running
